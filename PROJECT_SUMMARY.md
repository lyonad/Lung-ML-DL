X_scaled = (X - Œº) / œÉ
where Œº = mean, œÉ = std
```

**Purpose:**

train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y)
```

### Abstract Template

```
Background: Limited availability of large-scale medical datasets in developing 
countries necessitates evaluation of machine learning approaches suitable for 
small data scenarios with severe class imbalance.

Objective: Compare Deep Learning (Artificial Neural Networks) with Classical 
Machine Learning (Random Forest) for lung cancer risk prediction using a 
small-scale clinical dataset from Pakistan (n=309, 87% positive class).

Methods: Four ANN architectures and Random Forest were trained with class weight 
balancing. Eight optimization algorithms were implemented including Youden's J 
statistic for threshold optimization, Adam optimizer, grid search, and feature 
scaling. Models were evaluated on 15 clinical features using 10+ metrics.

Results: Random Forest achieved best practical performance (91.94% accuracy, 
100% specificity) after optimization. Youden's J threshold optimization improved 
LOW_RISK detection from 25% to 100% specificity. Class weight balancing (3.98x 
for minority class) and optimal thresholds (ANN: 0.6862, RF: 0.5467) significantly 
improved balanced accuracy from 59.7% to 90.0%. All 8/8 LOW_RISK test samples 
correctly identified.

Conclusions: Traditional ML (Random Forest) outperforms Deep Learning on severely 
imbalanced small datasets when proper optimization algorithms are applied. 
Youden's J statistic and class weight balancing are critical for imbalanced 
medical data. StandardScaler consistency between training and production is 
essential for accurate predictions.

Clinical Implications: For resource-constrained healthcare settings with 
imbalanced data, Random Forest with class weights and ROC-optimized thresholds 
offers optimal performance (100% specificity, 92.6% sensitivity) with faster 
deployment and built-in interpretability.

Technical Innovation: First implementation demonstrating that computer science 
optimization algorithms (Youden's J, class weights, adaptive learning) can 
achieve perfect LOW_RISK detection on severely imbalanced clinical datasets.
