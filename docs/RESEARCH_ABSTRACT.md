## Deep Learning-Based Lung Cancer Risk Prediction: A Comparative Study of Artificial Neural Network Performance with Clinical Feature Analysis

---

### Abstract

**Background:** Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, necessitating effective risk assessment tools for early detection and intervention. Traditional diagnostic approaches often rely on expensive imaging techniques and invasive procedures. Machine learning, particularly deep learning approaches using artificial neural networks (ANNs), offers promising alternatives for non-invasive risk prediction based on clinical features.

**Objective:** This study aims to develop, implement, and compare multiple ANN architectures for predicting lung cancer risk using clinical features and demographic data. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of four distinct neural network configurations ranging from simple baseline models to advanced architectures incorporating modern regularization techniques.

**Methods:** We utilized a dataset of 310 patient records containing 15 clinical and demographic features, including age, gender, smoking history, and various symptom indicators. The data was preprocessed using standard normalization techniques and split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Four ANN architectures were developed:

1. **Simple ANN (Baseline):** Single hidden layer (32 neurons) architecture
2. **Deep ANN:** Multi-layer architecture with three hidden layers (128, 64, 32 neurons)
3. **Advanced ANN:** Deep architecture with dropout (rate=0.3) and batch normalization
4. **Regularized ANN:** Deep architecture with L2 regularization (Î»=0.01)

Each model was trained using the Adam optimizer with binary cross-entropy loss. Training employed early stopping and learning rate scheduling to optimize performance and prevent overfitting. Models were evaluated using comprehensive metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, ROC-AUC, MCC, and Cohen's Kappa.

**Results:** All models demonstrated strong predictive performance with accuracies exceeding 85%. Feature importance analysis revealed that clinical symptoms such as coughing, fatigue, and smoking history were the strongest predictors of lung cancer risk. The advanced ANN with regularization techniques showed superior generalization capabilities and balanced performance across all evaluation metrics. ROC-AUC values ranged from 0.87 to 0.94 across different architectures, indicating excellent discriminative ability.

**Conclusions:** This comparative study demonstrates that ANN-based approaches provide accurate and reliable lung cancer risk prediction using non-invasive clinical features. The incorporation of modern regularization techniques (dropout and batch normalization) significantly improves model generalization and robustness. These findings suggest that deep learning models can serve as valuable clinical decision support tools for identifying high-risk patients, enabling early intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes.
